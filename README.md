**used Car Price Prediction**

This project predicts used car prices using machine learning. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and model training with LightGBM and scikit-learn. The notebook outputs predictions for a test set and generates a CSV file for submission.

## Features
- Data cleaning and feature extraction
- Handling missing values and categorical encoding
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Final prediction and CSV export

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, lightgbm, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage
1. Place your data in the `archive/` folder.
2. Run `used_car_price_prediction.ipynb`.
3. Find predictions in `SubmissionNN.csv`.
