Used Car Price Prediction
This project predicts the prices of used cars using machine learning techniques. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and model training with LightGBM and scikit-learn. The model is trained on a dataset of used car listings and outputs predicted prices for a test set. The code is organized in a Jupyter Notebook for easy reproducibility and understanding.
